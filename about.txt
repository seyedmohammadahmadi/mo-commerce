- React app created with vite
- Use TailwindCSS for styling (add MUI, AntD, shadcn, or whatever you need)
- State management : use whatever you want
- Froms : use react-hook-form alongside a schema validator like yup or zod
- API : json-server
- Table : whatever table component (like AG Grid, MUI table, ...)
- Slider : whatever slider or swiper component (like react-swiper)

---------------------------------------------

Routes :
/ => main page --- a slider of a few products
/login => login page (username only)
/products => products landing page --- list of all products in a responsive grid layout with pagination and sort by price and stockCount filters
/products/:id => product detail page --- a single page that shows basic information about the product with the clicked dynamic product-id
/users --- list of all users in a table

* /users route is protected (needs user to login) that only the user with ADMIN role can access. ADMIN can see, update, delete, create users (use json-server for CRUD)
